# High-Redshift-Quasars-with-Random-Forests

Code underlying the work Wenzl et al. 2021 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09171)

Large files are removed. All the catalog data is publicly available from the different observatories or by contacting me (Lukas Wenzl). To rerun the code from scratch a few hundret GByte of RAM are necessary otherwise adaptations are needed.

The final data product, called the high-z candidates catalog is available under datasets/highz_candidates_selection_to_release_May2021.csv

Part of the code is based on https://github.com/jtschindler/qso_class_photoz by Jan-Torge Schindler. For full references see the paper.
